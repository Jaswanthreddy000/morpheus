## Briefly write about the project that you have submitted from the perspective of the user.
This project is a Form Builder application that functions similarly to Google Forms. As a user, you can easily navigate to the form list, select a form to respond to, and submit your answers. The application also provides analytics to give insights into the responses received.

## Assumptions you have made for this project?
1) Users have a basic understanding of how to navigate a web application.
2) The server and database are properly set up and configured.
3) Users have access to a modern web browser.
4) Users will input valid data in the forms.

## Other information (like testing credentials)
No specific credentials are needed to explore this project.
Only admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ with the superuser credentials created during setup.

## Did you learn anything new while doing this assignment? Please explain.
Yes, this assignment helped solidify my understanding of Django models, views, and templates. I also improved my skills in setting up and configuring a MySQL database with Django. Additionally, I gained experience in implementing form analytics and handling user inputs.

## How much time did it take for you complete the project?
It took approximately 1-1.5 day to complete the project, including setting up the environment, developing the application, testing, and writing documentation.

## If you had more time, what enhancements will you make?
1) Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain features.
2) Implement real-time analytics and data visualization for more dynamic insights.
